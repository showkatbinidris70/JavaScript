        //Exercise-5:Choose the correct conditional (ternary) operator to console  
        //"Too young" if age is less than 18, otherwise alert "Old enough" (2)

        var myAge = 18;
        var result = myAge ? "Too young" : "Old enough";

//Exercise-6:When to Use if else vs ternary vs switch? (2)

        /*
        A ternary operator is used when we have both an if and else statement and only single execution 
        statements inside them. We use the switch statement when we need to compare one value against many
         others. Conditional statements can be nested inside other conditional statements.
