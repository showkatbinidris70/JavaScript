        //Exercise 1
        //1.What are the complex data type in JavaScript?
        /*
        There are 2 type of data type in JavaScript primitive data type & non primitive data type
            non primitive data type's others name is complex data type.
            Complex data types are array & object
            const person = ['Showkat', 20, 'Dhaka'];
            const person = {
                name: 'Showkat',
                age: 20,
                city: 'Dhaka'
            }
        */

        //Exercise 2
        //2.When and why to use Array vs object (Mention 3 point) -3
        /*
        We can use Array & Object when we want to contain more then one data in a variable.
        (i) -> We use Array when we need index base data,Array index is numerical.
        (ii)-> We use Object when we need key, value pair data. 
        (iii)-> Object can contain nested object, array & function.
        */
        //Exercise 3
        //3.Create an profile object that has your firstName, lastName, and occupation as keys.-3
        const profile = {
            firstName: "Showkat",
            lastName: "Ali",
            occupation: "Service"
        }
        // profile.hobby = "Swimming";
        // console.log(profile);
        // delete profile["occupation"];

        // console.log(profile.firstName);
        // console.log(profile["lastName"]);
        // console.log(profile);

        //Exercise 4
        //4.when to use dot notation vs bracket notation to access data from object? -2
        /*
        Dot notation is faster to write and easier to read than bracket notation.
        However, we can use variables with bracket notation, but not with dot notation.
        This is especially useful for situations when we want to access a property
        but don't know the name of the property ahead of time
        */

        //Exercise 5
        //5.Write down the multiple ways to define an array and object -2
        const arr = [];
        const arrName = new Array();

        const obj = {};
        const objName = new Object({});

        //Exercise 6
        //6.Nested data access from array and object -4
        const userObj = {
            name: 'samim',
            address: {
                city: "Dhaka",
                university: {
                    name: 'Dhaka University'
                }
            }
        }
        console.log(userObj.address.university.name);

        const userArr = ["samim", ["Dhaka", ["Dhaka University"]]];
        console.log(userArr[1][1][0]);
